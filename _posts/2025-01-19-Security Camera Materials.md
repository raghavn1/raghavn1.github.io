## Project layout and file structure on the Pi
- `/Users`{: .filepath} - Main folder
    - `/etc`{: .filepath} - Subfolder usually used for config files
        - `/motion`{: .filepath} - Folder where the `motion.conf`{: .filepath} and different `cameraX.conf`{: .filepath} files are held
            - `/motion.config`{: .filepath} - Main config file that applies settings to all cameras that are currently picked up by Motion
    - `/var`{: .filepath} - Folder where variable/changing files are stored
        - `/lib`{: .filepath} - Holds the shared library images needed to boot and run
            - `/motion`{: .filepath} - Folder for the changing files in Motion (specifically the saved video/image files)
                - `/"VideoFileName.mp4"`{: .filepath} - All the list of files that are saved by Motion from the recording of detected movement
    - `/tmp`{: .filepath} - Usually stores the temporary files generated by running programs
        - `/motion`{: .filepath} - Folder specifically for temporary Motion files
            - `/motion.log`{: .filepath} - The Motion log file that the program writes to for any alerts, notices, or errors
